# VittorioFaraco.com Custom WordPress Theme

This is the custom WordPress theme I've developed and I've maintained for a while for my personal website.

I also used it as a basis for other projects, since it was built to be as minimal, clean and small as possible.

That said, it could be further minimized, plus the new block themes caught my attention. I'm working on newer bases to use and I'll update my Github whenever they'll be ready.

This theme is mainly composed of PHP, HTML and CSS, with almost no JS.
