# Custom WordPress Theme

Custom WordPress theme I developed and maintained for my website, and that I use as foundation for other projects.

The theme meets WordPress requirements and is designed to be as small as possible, even though a few adjustments can still be made.

I'm currently working on other and newer themes (also block based) that will serve as successor of this one.

The project contains PHP, JS, HTML and CSS (also jQuery and a small CSS animation library).
